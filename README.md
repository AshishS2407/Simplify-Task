# Hyperledger Fabric Asset Management System

## Overview
This project is a **Hyperledger Fabric** blockchain application for managing assets securely. It includes functionalities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting assets, with role-based access control (RBAC) ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.

## Features
- **Admin:** Can create, update, and delete assets.
- **User:** Can read assets they own.
- **Auditor:** Can view all assets.
- **Chaincode:** Implements business logic for asset transactions.
- **Blockchain Network:** Built on **Hyperledger Fabric**.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16+ recommended)
- **npm** 
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Hyperledger Fabric** (v2.2 or later)
- **Fabric Samples** & CLI Tools
